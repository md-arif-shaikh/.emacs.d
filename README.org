* Build emacs from source for solus os / ubuntu os
  For many reasons one may prefer to build emacs from source. It might
  be that the most recent version is not available on your distro or
  you may want to compile emacs with support for specific
  libraries. For example ~lsp-mode~ users would like to have support for
  the ~libjansson~ library. In such case you can clone the emacs repo
  and the build it with support for the desired libraries. The
  original [[https://gist.github.com/kiennq/0f3e65098725b1f9708da8c92972e705][script]] was for ubuntu based systems, I have added support
  for [[solus os][https://getsol.us/home/]]. Look at the shell script [[./build_emacs.sh][here]].
* Configuration File
Read [[./emacs.org][emacs.org]] for configuration using available packages.
* Convert time between time zones
* Display org-agenda in Bangla
* Download papers from arxiv and other websites
* Search for arxiv papers
  - There exists a package called [[https://github.com/fizban007/arxiv-mode][arxiv-mode]] which seems to cover a lot
    of the needs. I have not personally used it. Instead I use my own
    simple function to search arxiv. It searches the results and
    writes them in a org file so that I can go through them and use
    all org-mode goodies.
  - Currently it supports search by author name or using a date range
    mimicking the advance search option of arxiv.
  - Link to function [[./lisp/arxiv-search.el][arxiv-search.el]].
