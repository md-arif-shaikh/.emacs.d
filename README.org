* Build emacs from source for solus os / ubuntu os
  For many reasons one may prefer to build emacs from source. It might
  be that the most recent version is not available on your distro or
  you may want to compile emacs with support for specific
  libraries. For example ~lsp-mode~ users would like to have support for
  the ~libjansson~ library. In such case you can clone the emacs repo
  and then build it with support for the desired libraries. This script
  can be used for [[https://ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]]  and [[https://getsol.us/home/][Solus]]. Get the shell script [[./build_emacs.sh][here]].
* Configuration File
Read [[./emacs.org][emacs.org]] for configuration using available packages.
