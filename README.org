  - There exists a package called [[https://github.com/fizban007/arxiv-mode][arxiv-mode]] which seems to cover a lot
    of the needs. I have not personally used it. Instead I use my own
    simple function to search arxiv. It searches the results and
    writes them in a org file so that I can go through them and use
    all org-mode goodies.
  - Currently it supports search by author name or using a date range
    mimicking the advance search option of arxiv.
  - Link to function [[./lisp/arxiv-search.el][arxiv-search.el]].
  - Search by author
