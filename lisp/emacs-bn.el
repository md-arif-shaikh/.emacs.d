an existing one.  See the function `display-buffer'.

type \\[next-history-element] to pull it into the minibuffer.

The first time \\[next-history-element] is used after Emacs prompts for
the file name, the result is affected by `file-name-at-point-functions',
which by default try to guess the file name by looking at point in the
current buffer.  Customize the value of `file-name-at-point-functions'

current directory to be available on first \\[next-history-element]

expand wildcards (if any) and visit multiple files."

You can visit files on remote machines by specifying something
like /ssh:SOME_REMOTE_MACHINE:FILE for the file name.  You can
also visit local files as a different user by specifying
/sudo::FILE for the file name.
See the Info node `(tramp)File name Syntax' in the Tramp Info
manual, for more about this.

Interactively, or if WILDCARDS is non-nil in a call from Lisp,
expand wildcards (if any) and visit multiple files.  You can
suppress wildcard expansion by setting `find-file-wildcards' to nil.

To visit a file without any kind of conversion and without
automatically choosing a major mode, use \\[find-file-literally]."

  "Save current buffer in visited file if modified.
Variations are described below.

By default, makes the previous version into a backup file
 if previously requested or if this is the first save.
Prefixed with one \\[universal-argument], marks this version
 to become a backup when the next save is done.
Prefixed with two \\[universal-argument]'s,
 makes the previous version into a backup file.
Prefixed with three \\[universal-argument]'s, marks this version
 to become a backup when the next save is done,
 and makes the previous version into a backup file.

With a numeric prefix argument of 0, never make the previous version
into a backup file.

Note that the various variables that control backups, such
as `version-control', `backup-enable-predicate', `vc-make-backup-files',
and `backup-inhibited', to name just the more popular ones, still
control whether a backup will actually be produced, even when you
invoke this command prefixed with two or three \\[universal-argument]'s.

If a file's name is FOO, the names of its numbered backup versions are
 FOO.~i~ for various integers i.  A non-numbered backup file is called FOO~.
Numeric backups (rather than FOO~) will be made if value of
 `version-control' is not the atom `never' and either there are already
 numeric versions of the file being backed up, or `version-control' is
 non-nil.
We don't want excessive versions piling up, so there are variables
 `kept-old-versions', which tells Emacs how many oldest versions to keep,
 and `kept-new-versions', which tells how many newest versions to keep.
 Defaults are 2 old versions and 2 new.
`dired-kept-versions' controls dired's clean-directory (.) command.
If `delete-old-versions' is nil, system will query user
 before trimming versions.  Otherwise it does it silently.

If `vc-make-backup-files' is nil, which is the default,
 no backup files are made for files managed by version control.
 (This is because the version control system itself records previous versions.)

See the subroutine `basic-save-buffer' for more information."
